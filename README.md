```
If you came here
by yourself tonight
Cause he wouldn't
pick up the phone
He was supposed to bring
you here tonight
Couldn't find him
so you came alone
It don't matter
cause your here now
and the music your enjoyin
So for the next couple minutes
Baby I'ma be your boyfriend
Pretty mama
if your single single
You don't gotta
be alone tonight
So while the DJ play
this single single
Just pretend that
I'm your man tonight
So you don't gotta be alone
I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
girl I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend till
this song goes on
So you don't gotta be alone
I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
girl I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
<♪>
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
He don't tell
that your beautiful
Let me tell it you to the beat
He don't tell you
that he loves you girl
Let me sing it in a harmony
Let my song get you higher
We never have
to come back down
And if you ever
you should miss me
Just tell the DJ
run it back now
Pretty mama
if your single single
You don't gotta be
alone tonight
So while DJ play
this single single
Just pretend that
I'm your man tonight
So you don't gotta be alone
I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
girl I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
So you don't gotta be alone
I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
girl I'll be your boyfriend
So you don't gotta be alone
baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
<♪>
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
<♪>
Be your boyfriend
till this song goes on
